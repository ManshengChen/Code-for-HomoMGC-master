***The source code of HomoMGC is used for ICDM2024 submission.***

There are some tips about this code in the following,

1. Open demo.m to run HomoMGC. You can replace the dataset in the experiment as you want, 
and we use ACM3025 as an example.

2. After obtaining the predicted label "pre_gt" generated by HomoMGC, we save the groundtruth 
label "gt" and the predicted label "pre_gt" in "ACM3025_results.mat".

3. For fairness, the same evaluation method (represented by the python code) as baselines is used, 
i.e., "main.py" and "evaluation.py". Then, we can compute our clustering results by running "main.py".

The parameter values of different datasets are provided as follows,

ACM       k=5, \gamma=0.001

DBLP      k=20, \gamma=0.01

Texas     k=5, \gamma=2

ACM_HR0.00      k=10, \gamma=0.001

ACM_HR0.10     k=10, \gamma=0.001

ACM_HR0.20     k=10, \gamma=0.001

ACM_HR0.30     k=15, \gamma=0.0001

ACM_HR0.40     k=10, \gamma=0.01

ACM_HR0.50     k=10, \gamma=0.01
